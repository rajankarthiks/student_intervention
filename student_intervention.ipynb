    "\n",
    "* The learning models i think which are appropriate for this binary classification problem are **Decision Tree learning model**, **Support Vector Machines** learning model and **Ensemble Bagging classification learning model** with K-Nearest Neighbor estimator. *\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision Trees Classification learning models** are simple yet most successful form of non-parametric learning algorithm. A Decision Tree learning model maps the input situation described by a set of attributes to an output called decision which is the predicted output value for the input. A decision tree learning model reaches its decision by performing a sequence of test. Each node in the decision tree corresponds to a test of the value of one the input properties, and the branches from the node are assigned with the possible values of the test. If a node doesn't contain any node then it is called a leaf node and it holds the value to be returned of any particular test. Decision Tree learning models create a decision boundary surface form the sample data and predicts the class of the unseen input data based on the boundary surface developed from the sample data. Advantages of Decision Tree learning model is that they are simple to understand and can easily visualised. These models will be able to handle both the numerical and categorical data. Disadvantages of these learning models are that they can create over complex tress that do not generalize the data well and suffer from overfitting. Since the decisions are made at each node locally, it cannot guarantee to produce globally optimal decision trees. Especially, these models can create biased decision trees if some classes in the data dominate. ie, Decision trees are not good for data with skewed distributions. Since the cost of using and predicting the data is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree, it is cost efficient and considering the school has limited computational resources this model makes a good fit for this problem. Also our data has more number of categorical data and we have to predict the discrete output weather the student will pass or fail, this make this learning model a good candidate for this given problem. Some of the real world applications of this learning model are in the domain of Business management in paricular with customer relationship management and fraud detection. Reference: http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/. The training time for this model is O(n_{features}n_{samples}^{2}\\log(n_{samples})). The query time is O(\\log(n_{samples})).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Support Vector Machines** are supervised learning models can be used for both the classification and regression tasks. However, in this section we will focus only on using this learning model for classification problem since our goal is to predict discrete ouput values. ie, the student will pass or not. This learning algorithm tries to build a model that represents the data given beloning to each of the classes. This model represents the examples as data points in space, mapped such that each seperate categories are made distinct by clear gaps between each of the classes which as wide as possible. New unseen example data are mapped into the same space and predicted to which category they belong. This learning model is particularly useful to classify linear data points. However, this model can also perform well with non-linear classification using a trick called kernal trick in which the model makes the data points to be linearly seperable in a higher dimensional space according to the input feature vector. Some of the real world implementation of support vector machine learning models are in the area of text categorization, image recognition, bio informatics. However this type of models are not limited to these applications and can be used in many other ways. Text categorization is the task of classifying text documents into a predefiend number of given categories. Reference - https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0612817.pdf . Advantages of SVM's are that these models are effective with high dimensional spaces even is the number of features is greater than the number of samples. When prediction a new unseen data, it only uses a subset of the sample space called support vectors, these model are memory efficient.These models are highly versatile in terms of defining the kernal functions which makes it to adjust to broad array of applications. Disadvantages are that these models give poor performance if the number of features are very much greater than the sample space. Also, these models do not provide direct probability estimates, but these can be calculated using expensive k-fold cross validation techniques.Since our data of students has a good number of features, this model promotes itself as a good candidate of the given problem. This model has a space complexity of O(n^2) where n is the input data size. It has a training time of O(n^3) where n is the training dataset size.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ensemble Bagging classifier** with K-Nearest Neighbors estimator. The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning alogrithm (in our case KNN) in order to improve the generalizability or to make more robust when compared to a single base estimator. There are two types of ensemble methods. One is averaging method where several estimators are build and their predictions are averaged. Other method of ensemle learning is boosting method where multiple base estimators built sequentialy one over the other and tries to reduce the bias of the previously combined estimator. In this problem we will proceed with ensemble bagging classifier combined with K-Nearest Neighbors classification learning model. The K-nearest neighbor classification model is a type of instance based learning where the generalized model will not be constructed, instead the model will store all the training instances and classification of new unseen data are computed from simple majority votes of the nearest neighbors of each data point. Here k, means the number of nearest neighbors to be considered. The advantages of using ensemble bagging classification is that multiple base estimator's predictions are averaged and usually this increases the generalizability of the learning model. Disadvantages are that in order to average the predictions of multiple base estimators, the same has to be be calculated so the running time of this model is usually high. Real world implementations of these kinds of learning models are some in the areas of Remote Sensing, Person recognition, One Vs all recognition, Medicine which require large number of inputs, large number of features. Finger print recognition, face recognition are some applications of ensemble methods in the domain of person recognition.
